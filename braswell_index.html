<p>Through age-appropriate curriculum and a well-trained teaching staff, Braswell children are learning from their first day of enrollment.  Infancy is a time for quality nurturing and loving care that reassures our smallest ones that their needs are not only met, but that they are planned for and addressed.   As children mature and begin to explore their minds are opened to a medley of learning opportunities such as field trips to the zoo, aquarium, arboretum and museum.</p>

			<p>Our program allows children to grow and develop through a developmentally-appropriate curriculum centered on exploration and play.  A warm environment with child/teacher interaction is displayed daily.</p>
			<h3>Pre – K: 3 and 4 years of age</h3>
			<p>We provide a variety of stimulating experiences and tools to facilitate cognitive development.
Our print-rich environment increases language,  math concepts are introduced through play and age appropriate science activities and experienced on a weekly basis.
We have an outstanding hand bell choir that performs during our year-end graduation program.</p>
			<h3>School Aged Children</h3>
			<p>We offer a variety of opportunities to learn through play. Our afterschool program aligns with the schools we serve to support our students in their homework through tutoring. In addition, we offer science activities to peak their interest and support their creativity.  Supervised games and on-site roller skating develop gross motor skills while having just plain FUN! The fun continues during Summer and Winter Camp sessions.</p>
